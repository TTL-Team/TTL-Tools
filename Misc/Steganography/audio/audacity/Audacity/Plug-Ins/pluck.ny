; original pluck.ny modified by David R.Sky October 2007
; [vastly simplified later]
; to give user option to use [default] abrupt or gradual fade-out,
; and ability to make pluck sound up to 30 seconds in duration.
; Modified January 2007 to use 'snd-pluck' by edgar-rft@web.de
; instead of the Nyquist 'pluck' function, and normalise to 0.8
; maximum amplitude. As defined in Audacity, 'pluck' has 
; incorrect length duration and clipping at the start which gives
; rise to DC offset. Using 'snd-pluck' avoids the clipping and 
; offset so we don't need the highpass8 filter that we used before.  


; set final-amp for abrupt or gradual fade
(setf final-amp (if (= fade 1) 0.001 0.000001))

(let* ((pluck-sound (snd-pluck *sound-srate* (step-to-hz p) 0 dur final-amp))
       (max-peak (peak pluck-sound ny:all)))
  (scale (/ 0.8 max-peak) pluck-sound))

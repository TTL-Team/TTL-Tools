<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_can_I_not_record_in_Windows.3F">Why can I not record in Windows?</span></h2>
<p>On Windows systems, you may receive "Error while opening sound device" when you try to record. This typically happens when you first use Audacity for recording and have no audio input devices (or only the built-in microphone) showing in <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a>.  See <a href="faq_errors.html#sound_device" title="FAQ:Errors">Why do I get "Error while opening sound device"?</a> for more details on this error.
</p><p>If your <a href="device_toolbar.html#host" title="Device Toolbar">Audio Host</a> is not already set to <a href="glossary.html#mme" title="Glossary">MME</a> <i>(the Audacity default)</i> in Device Toolbar, try changing it to MME as this host is the most compatible with all audio devices. 
</p><p>To investigate this further, exit Audacity then on Windows Vista and later, right-click over the <span class="menu">Speaker icon</span> by the system clock and choose <span class="menu">Recording Devices</span>. This opens the <i>Recording</i> tab of Windows "Sound". Follow the steps on our  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Mixer_Toolbar_Issues#vistacp">instructions for Windows "Sound"</a> to show then enable all disconnected and disabled recording devices. On Windows XP you can perform the same tasks using our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Mixer_Toolbar_Issues#xpcp">instructions for Windows Sounds and Audio Devices</a>. 
</p><p>Many new Windows laptop, notebook or netbook computers only have a single audio input port. This will often be a mono port only meant for microphones. On some machines this single port may also be able to accept stereo line level input which is essential to record from standalone cassette decks or home audio systems. However the stereo quality or separation may be poor.  See "<a href="how_to_connect_your_equipment.html" title="How to connect your equipment">How to connect your equipment</a>" before connecting high output devices to a sole input.

<p>To listen while Audacity is recording, enable what is known as hardware or software playthrough as explained below. If you use software playthrough and want to listen to the input without recording it, you must also left-click in the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter Toolbar</a> to turn on <a href="meter_toolbar.html#monitoring" title="Meter Toolbar">monitoring</a>.   
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Windows_and_Linux">Windows and Linux</span></h3>
<p>Open the computer's volume control panel. In the playback section, turn off the “mute” checkbox or button for your recording source (usually “microphone” or “line in”) then turn its volume up. This is known as <i>hardware playthrough</i>. You will be able to hear the recording with very little playthrough <i><b><a href="glossary.html#latency" title="Glossary">latency</a></b></i>.
</p><p>If this does not work, open the Audacity <a href="preferences.html" title="Preferences">Preferences</a>. In the <a href="recording_preferences.html" title="Recording Preferences">Recording</a> section on the left, put a checkmark in the “Software Playthrough” box and click OK. You can also turn Software Playthrough on and off in the <a href="transport_menu.html#playthrough" title="Transport Menu">Transport Menu</a>. This type of playthrough has latency, so you will hear what you are recording a noticeable time afterwards. You could also experience audio breakup.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mac_OS_X">Mac OS X</span></h3>
<p>Open the Audacity <a href="preferences.html" title="Preferences">Preferences</a>. In the <a href="recording_preferences.html" title="Recording Preferences">Recording</a> section on the left,  put a checkmark in the “Software Playthrough” box and click OK. You can also turn Software Playthrough on and off in the <a href="transport_menu.html#playthrough" title="Transport Menu">Transport Menu</a>. 
</p>
<ul><li> If Software Playthrough has too much latency, you could try turning it off and enabling "Hardware Playthrough" instead. Unfortunately, with most modern Mac hardware, no audio is actually produced using this option.  
</li><li> If Software Playthrough does not produce audio, try the free <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/">LineIn</a> application.   
</li></ul>
<div class="note">For professional multi-track recordings you may find that Audacity's Software Playthrough has unacceptable latency.
<ul><li> If the computer's built-in sound device lacks hardware playthrough, you can buy an external USB or Firewire device and hardware monitor through its headphones jack with near zero latency. 
</li><li> Alternatively, lower latency software playthrough may be possible using the computer sound device.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_there_a_delay_or_echo_when_listening_to_what_I_am_recording.3F">Why is there a delay or echo when listening to what I am recording?</span></h2>
<p><a href="recording_preferences.html#playthrough" title="Recording Preferences">Software playthrough</a> usually causes a delay (latency) of the live recording input due to the time it takes to reach your headphones. To prevent this, turn software playthrough off. This can be done most conveniently by choosing <span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu.html#playthrough" title="Transport Menu">Software Playthrough (on/off)</a></span> and clicking it to remove the check (tick) mark.
</p><p>To listen to the live recording input without playthrough latency requires <b>hardware</b> monitoring - that is; the input signal must be routed directly through the audio device from the input to the output rather than being passed through software from input to output.
</p><p>Enabling hardware monitoring is not possible with all audio devices. In particular it can only be achieved when the same device is used for input and output. For example, monitoring a USB microphone through headphones that are plugged into a different audio device will always have latency. If hardware playthrough is not available with your hardware it may be necessary to listen to the audio source directly (acoustically) rather than through the computer.  
</p><p>For some typical examples of how to set up equipment to record without playthrough latency, see this Tutorial about <a href="tutorial_recording_multi_track_overdubs.html" title="Tutorial - Recording Multi-track Overdubs">Recording overdubs</a>.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_do_my_recordings_fade_out_or_sound_as_if_they_were_made_in_a_tunnel.3F">Why do my recordings fade out or sound as if they were made in a tunnel?</span></h2>
<p>This issue is common on new Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines and can occasionally occur on newer Mac computers. These and other symptoms can also occur on other machines if the sound device is applying an effect or a corrective enhancement. 
</p>
<ul><li> If the recording is fading out after a few seconds, look for a "<b>Noise Suppression</b>" setting you can turn off in the <i>Recording</i> side of the sound device settings. 
</li><li> If the recording sounds like it was made in a tunnel, look for an "<b>Echo Cancellation</b>" setting you can turn off. 
<ul><li> If there is no echo cancellation setting or it doesn't help, look for "<b>Environment</b>" sound effects in the <i>Playback</i> side of the sound device settings - these will affect recordings of computer playback and sometimes other recordings too.   
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>To change settings on <b>Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8</b>:
</p>
<ol><li> Right-click over the <span class="menu">Speaker icon</span> by the system clock then choose <span class="menu">Recording Devices</span> to open the <i>Recording</i> tab of "Sound" 
</li><li> Right-click over <span class="menu">Microphone</span> (or whatever device you are recording from) and choose <span class="menu"> Properties</span> 
</li><li> There will probably be an <i>Enhancements</i> tab where you can disable all or selected "Sound Effects" - if needs be, also look in the <i>Levels</i> or <i>Custom</i> tabs
</li><li> You may also need to change or disable environment settings. To check settings, click the <i>Playback</i> tab in the main window of "Sound", right-click over <span class="menu">Speakers</span>, choose <span class="menu"> Properties</span> then click the <i>Enhancements</i> tab.     
</li></ol>
<p>If there are no settings to change, or on <b>older versions of Windows</b>, go to the "Sound" or similar section of the Windows Control Panel and look for a custom control panel for your sound device.
</p><p>On <b>Mac OS X</b>:
</p>
<ol><li> Navigate <span class="menu">Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Hardware &gt; Sound</span> 
</li><li> Choose the "Input" tab and ensure that "Use ambient noise reduction" is unchecked. You may have to select the built-in internal microphone to make this checkbox visible. If checked, it may apply effects to external microphones as well as the internal microphone.  
</li></ol>
<div class="note">
<p>Unwanted fading or poor quality can sometimes be caused by inappropriate or outdated sound device drivers. For help, see our Wiki page <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Updating_Sound_Device_Drivers">Updating Sound Device Drivers</a>.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_my_new_track_out_of_sync_with_the_previous_ones.2C_or_sounds_crackly_or_at_wrong_pitch.3F">Why is my new track out of sync with the previous ones, or sounds crackly or at wrong pitch?</span></h2>
<p>When you make an <a href="faq_recording_how_to_s.html#overdub" title="FAQ:Recording - How To's">overdub recording</a> (listening to an existing track while recording a new one), computers can't lay down what you record at the exact instant you sing or play in response to the beat. Therefore without intervention, the recording inevitably gets laid down after the beat. Audacity tries to correct for this "recording latency" automatically by pushing the recorded track backwards after recording stops, but further adjustment may be needed. 
</p><p>If a new track is not synchronized with the others, you can zoom in and use <a href="tools_toolbar.html#timeshift" title="Tools Toolbar">Time Shift Tool</a> ( shortcut <span class="key">F5</span> ) to drag the track to the correct location. If you are doing a lot of overdubbing, try our <a href="latency_test.html" title="Latency Test">Latency Test</a> to set a custom value for Audacity's latency correction which can then be applied in <a href="recording_preferences.html" title="Recording Preferences">Recording Preferences</a>.
</p>
<div class="note">
<p><a href="tutorial_recording_multi_track_overdubs.html" title="Tutorial - Recording Multi-track Overdubs">Tutorial - Recording Multi-track Overdubs</a> gives a step-by-step 
guide for manually correcting for latency.
</p>
</div>
<p>Recording while playing is much more demanding for the sound device than simply recording. Hardware and sound driver problems or <i><b><a href="glossary.html#sample_rate" title="Glossary">sample&#160;rate</a></b></i> mismatches between Audacity, the operating system and the sound device can cause poor audio quality or make tracks play and record at different speeds. If a new track is being recorded at a different speed, it will progressively drift apart from the beat of the other tracks, so latency correction will never synchronize it correctly along its entire length. 
</p><p><b>To fix speed drift, pitch and quality problems, try the following tips.</b>   
</p>
<ul><li> Use the same device for playback and recording. 
</li><li> Ensure your sound device has <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Updating_Sound_Device_Drivers">up-to-date drivers</a> specifically intended for your particular computer model and operating system, as provided by the motherboard or sound device manufacturer. Ensure USB or Firewire devices have the manufacturer's latest firmware.
</li><li> If you hear crackling while playing and recording at the same time, try increasing the "Audio to buffer" setting in <a href="recording_preferences.html#Latency" title="Recording Preferences">Recording Preferences</a>. 
</li><li> If crackling occurs while playing the tracks together, check if the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#playback" title="Meter Toolbar">Playback Meter's</a> red <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i> warning is showing, which would indicate the combined volume of the tracks is too loud. To fix the clipping, use the <a href="audio_tracks.html#gain" title="Audio Tracks">gain sliders</a> on one or more tracks to reduce the overall level. 
</li><li> Set the <a href="selection_toolbar.html" title="Selection Toolbar">Project Rate</a> bottom left of the Audacity screen to 44100 Hz <i>(or if your soundcard only uses a particular rate such as 48000 Hz, set the project rate to that)</i>. Look at <span class="menu">Help &gt; <a href="help_menu.html#Audio_Device_Info..." title="Help Menu">Audio Device Info...</a></span> to see the rates the device claims to support.  
</li><li> Make sure the rate of the pre-existing tracks (as stated above the mute/solo buttons) is the same as the project rate. Select the tracks and click <span class="menu">Tracks &gt; <a href="tracks_menu.html#Resample..." title="Tracks Menu">Resample...</a></span> to resample the track to the project rate. 
</li><li> If you are on Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8:
<ul><li>Set the Audacity project rate to the same rate as the <b>Default Format</b> for your sound device. To view the "Default Format", go to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_OS#cp">Windows Control Panel</a>, select the Playback" and "Recording" tabs in turn, right-click over a device entry &gt; Properties, and look in the "Advanced" tab. If the playback and recording format rates are different, make them the same. Also make sure the number of recording channels set in the Audacity Preferences matches with that specified in Default Format. 
</li><li>If that does not help, select <b>Windows DirectSound</b> as the "host" in <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> in Audacity. On the "Advanced" tab of "Sound" in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_OS#cp">Windows Control Panel</a>, ensure both boxes for <b>Exclusive Mode</b> are checked. For this to work, the Audacity project rate <b>must</b> be a rate supported by your device and all other sample rate settings <b>must</b> be at that same rate.    
</li></ul>
</li><li> If you are recording with a USB or Firewire interface, sample rates and number of recording channels <b>must</b> be the same everywhere. Match the Audacity project rate and the number of recording channels set in the Audacity preferences with those specified:  
<ul><li> in the Windows <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Mixer_Toolbar_Issues#cp">Control Panel</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Mixer_Toolbar_Issues#osx">Apple Audio MIDI Setup</a>
</li><li> in any software control panel the device has 
</li><li> on any hardware control the device has.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none">Ensure your USB device is connected to a spare USB port of the computer and not to a USB hub.</ul> 
<ul><li> If you suspect recording dropouts as the cause of loss of synchronisation, read our tips about <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Managing_Computer_Resources_and_Drivers">managing computer resources</a>.
</li><li>To fix recordings already made which are out of step with other tracks, you can use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="effect_menu.html#Change_Speed..." title="Effect Menu">Change Speed...</a></span>; only a very modest speed change will be needed.

<p>The USB connection on electronic keyboards, pianos, drum machines or other electronic instruments is often a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> connection containing instructions with which MIDI software like Finale or Cubase can create notes of specific pitch and duration. Audacity cannot yet accept MIDI input, so it can only record an audio signal (the actual sound that the keyboard produces).
</p><p>If your keyboard manual says you can send audio over USB but there is a problem, try tightening or replacing the USB cable, ensure it is connected directly to a spare USB port on the computer, then restart Audacity or the computer. 
</p><p>In the absence of a USB audio output:
</p>
<ul><li> connect from the <b>AUX</b> or <b>Line</b> outputs of the keyboard to the line-in (blue) port of the computer 
</li><li> if there is no AUX or Line output, connect from the <b>headphones out</b> of the keyboard to computer line-in
</li><li> record using a <b>high quality microphone</b> - see <a href="tutorial_connecting_a_microphone.html" title="Tutorial - Connecting a Microphone">Connecting a Microphone</a>
</li><li> some keyboards may have a function to record direct to a USB flash or hard drive - choose WAV format if available if you want to edit the recordings in Audacity.
</li></ul>
<div class="note">Connecting from headphones out will disconnect the keyboard speakers. In this case you can use an adaptor that doubles the headphones out, or enable <span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu.html#playthrough" title="Transport Menu">Software Playthrough (on/off)</a></span> in Audacity to listen as you record. See <a href="tutorial_connecting_an_instrument.html" title="Tutorial - Connecting an Instrument">Tutorial - Connecting an Instrument</a> for details and images of suitable audio connectors.</div> 
<p>Many new laptop computers these days only come with a mono "microphone" (pink) input which will distort if you connect a keyboard to it. Occasionally the pink input can be switched to stereo line level in the audio control panel or may be "compatible" with stereo line level (this may not be of highest quality). Check your computer manual or experiment connecting from the keyboard headphones out with the volume <b>turned well down</b>. However in most cases it is preferable to purchase a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Recommended_sound_devices#USB_Interfaces">USB interface with line level input</a> instead.

<p>If you hear crackles, pops, or distortion when the recording is loud, or if the waveform is clearly touching the top and bottom edges of the track, you probably have <a href="audacity_waveform.html#clip" title="Audacity Waveform">clipping</a>, which means that the signal has exceeded the maximum allowed level.  
</p><p>Try lowering the recording level using the Audacity <a href="mixer_toolbar.html" title="Mixer Toolbar">Mixer Toolbar</a> or the slider in the operating system. You can also check to see if you can lower the volume on the input source itself (such as the <b>tape deck</b>,  <b>record player</b> or <b>microphone</b>). Many soundcards and USB turntables or USB tape decks have an independent volume control for the playback signal level.  See <a href="recording_with_usb_turntables.html" title="Recording with USB turntables">Recording with USB turntables or USB cassette decks</a> for more help with USB turntables or tape decks.

</li><li> On Windows, regularly defragment your hard disk drive (this should happen automatically on Windows Vista and later, but don't schedule defragmentation during a recording). Disable Windows Update while recording. Consider creating hardware or software profiles that load only essential hardware and services for a recording session. 
</li><li> Set Audacity to a higher priority in the operating system.   
</li><li> If you are using a USB recording device. connect directly to a USB port, not a hub.
</li><li> Whatever the audio device, ensure it has the latest <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Updating_Sound_Device_Drivers">drivers</a> as supplied by the motherboard or device manufacturer (as appropriate).   
</li><li> A faster processor or more <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> could help solve the problem.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_does_my_recording_keep_pausing_automatically_or_why_is_my_recording_cursor_stuck.3F">Why does my recording keep pausing automatically or why is my recording cursor stuck?</span></h2>
    
<p><b>Sound Activated Recording</b>
The recording cursor can legitimately appear to be stuck in Audacity if you have accidentally enabled <a href="transport_menu.html#sar" title="Transport Menu">Sound Activated Recording</a> in the <b>Transport Menu</b> and the current recording input is below the threshold level at which recording is set to start. You can tell this is the case because the blue Pause button will be depressed after you press Record. 
</p><p>To disable Sound Activated Recording, click the <span class="menu">Transport</span> menu and uncheck <i>Sound Activated Recording (on/off)</i>. 
</p><p>To make a Sound Activated recording commence, increase the recording level, or reduce the "Activation level" at <span class="menu">Transport &gt; Sound Activation Level...</span>.   
</p><p><b>Out of resources</b>
If you have not activated <a href="transport_menu.html#sar" title="Transport Menu">Sound Activated Recording</a> and the red recording cursor won't move from the position where you start to record or stalls while recording, this usually means you are out of computer resources. 
</p><p>Rebooting the computer may solve the problem.
</p><p>For an in-depth approach to resolving this please see the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Managing_Computer_Resources_and_Drivers#resources">Managing Computer Resources and Drivers</a> page in the Audacity Wiki.
</p><p><b>Preferences: Audio to buffer</b>
Also check the "Audio to buffer" setting; click <span class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences</span> then click the <a href="recording_preferences.html" title="Recording Preferences">Recording</a> tab.  
</p><p>This should normally be set to the default of 100 milliseconds; very low settings will prevent the recording starting.
</p><p><b>USB turntables and tape decks</b>
Reports of recordings from USB turntables freezing or having dropouts are not that uncommon. Generally they are <b>not</b> caused by Audacity, but by poor quality equipment and cables, or lack of sufficient USB bandwidth.   
</p>
<ul><li> Check the Project Rate bottom left of the Audacity screen is set to either 44100 or 48000 Hz - setting a very high rate might overload the USB bandwidth and cause transmission problems 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Check the USB cable for tightness at both ends and try using a different cable instead
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Always use a spare USB port, not a hub
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Limit USB bandwidth whilst recording by using other USB devices sparingly e.g. simply disconnecting from the internet may help if you use a USB modem for internet access. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Check for any system warnings (e.g. in Device Manager in Windows) about the Universal Serial Bus Controllers. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> There have been isolated reports that recordings freeze up if they are attempted whilst the unit's RCA cables are connected to an external input such as a home stereo, although concurrent recording and playing through external equipment is implied as being possible.  
</li></ul>
<p>Generally, if you find you can record into Audacity without interruption from another source such as a microphone plugged into your computer's microphone port, this implicates the turntable or USB cable. To check if other sources record satisfactorily, go to <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> and change the <a href="device_toolbar.html#record" title="Device Toolbar">Recording Device</a> to your inbuilt sound. 
</p><p>If recordings from sources other than the turntable are also freezing or have dropouts, there could be problems with insufficient computer resources, see above. Please see the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Managing_Computer_Resources_and_Drivers#resources">Managing Computer Resources and Drivers</a> page in the Audacity Wiki for tips on correcting this. 
</p><p>If you're using "software playthrough", it's also possible that  problems with your inbuilt sound device (used to play back your recording whilst you are making it) are disrupting the recording.

<p>If the red recording cursor moves across the screen but no waveform is drawn behind it (only a flat line), you need to start from the beginning and set up your recording device and input source properly. 
</p><p><b>Step 1: input device</b>
</p><p>Select the <b>Recording Device</b> you are using (such as microphone or line-in) in the dropdown selector of the Audacity <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a>. <i>The dropdown selector you need is the one with the microphone icon.</i>
</p><p>If you are plugging a microphone or line-in input directly into the jacks on the computer, or recording computer playback such as internet radio, choose the name of the built-in sound device or soundcard.
</p>
<div class="note"><b>By default, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 only enable the microphone input.</b> You must exit Audacity, then go to "Sound" in the Windows Control Panel to show and enable other inputs before you can record from them. Instructions can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Mixer_Toolbar_Issues#vistacp">here</a> in the Wiki.</div>        
<p>If you are connecting an external device to the computer, such as a USB soundcard, USB microphone or USB turntable, choose "USB Audio Codec" or similar.
</p>
<div class="note"><b>Detecting USB and Firewire devices:</b><br />If Audacity does not recognize the device, try exiting Audacity and relaunching it, or in current Audacity choose <span class="menu">Transport &gt; Rescan Audio Devices</span>. If that does not help, use the following steps.
<ol><li> Exit Audacity.
</li><li> Unplug all other USB devices, then switch off and unplug the recording device at the USB connection and at the mains <i>(on Windows, use the "Safely Remove Hardware" icon in the System Tray).</i>
</li><li> Plug the recording device into a spare USB port (not a USB hub), and switch it on.
</li><li> Wait a few minutes then completely shut down the computer and restart it. On <b>Windows 8</b> you should <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://superuser.com/questions/656459/disabling-hybrid-boot-in-windows-8?answertab=votes#tab-top">disable hybrid boot</a> (or on Windows 8.1, use Windows key and X, then choose "Shut Down") to ensure the USB drivers are fully re-initialised. 
</li><li> When the computer has finished rebooting, launch Audacity.
</li><li> If Audacity still does not recognize the device, try another USB cable, then repeat steps 1 to 5. 
</li></ol>
<p><b>Setting sample rates for USB or Firewire interfaces:</b><br />It's important to set the same sample rate in the project rate bottom left of the Audacity window, in the operating system mixer, in any settings in the device's control panel and on any controls on the device itself.</p></div>
<p><b>Step 2: playback device</b>
</p><p>Also in the dropdown selector of the Audacity <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> select the playback device you are using, usually this will be your computer's on-board soundcard. <i>The dropdown selector you need this time is the one with the loudspeaker icon.</i>
</p><p><b>Step 3: channels</b>
</p><p>In the Audacity <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> set the <b>Recording Channels</b> to <b>1 (mono)</b> or <b>2 (stereo)</b> as required.
</p><p><b>Step 4: recording signal level</b>
</p><p>In the <a href="mixer_toolbar.html" title="Mixer Toolbar">Mixer Toolbar</a>, adjust the <b>recording level</b> using the recording slider <i>(the one that has the "microphone" symbol)</i> in conjunction with the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter</a> level to set the correct recording level before starting to record for real. 
</p><p>If the Audacity recording slider does not control the recording level of the device, use the slider in the operating system instead. This is usually accessed by a loudspeaker icon near the system clock.

</li><li> On <b>Mac</b> OS X 10.4 or later, go to  <span class="menu">Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Audio-MIDI Setup: Audio Devices</span>. 
</li></ul>
<p>Ensure that any balance controls on your mixer, amplifier or record player/cassette deck are centrally placed. 
</p><p>For non-USB recordings, make sure you are using a clean, tightly connected <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Connecting_your_Equipment#trs">stereo plug</a>. Ensure that the computer port you are connecting to is stereo. Most microphone ports are mono.

</li><li>In the dialog box, put a check mark in <span class="button"><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:CheckboxChecked.png" class="image"><img alt="CheckboxChecked.png" src="../m/images/8/85/checkboxchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" /></a>&#160;Normalize maximum amplitude to:</span> and type the <i><b><a href="glossary.html#amplitude" title="Glossary">amplitude</a></b></i> level you require <i>(-6 dB is a good choice if you have further editing to do)</i>.  
</li><li>Put a check mark in <span class="button"><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:CheckboxChecked.png" class="image"><img alt="CheckboxChecked.png" src="../m/images/8/85/checkboxchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" /></a>&#160;Normalize stereo channels independently</span>. Then press the <span class="button">OK</span> button.
</li></ol>
<p>This will adjust the volume of each channel independently so that both have the same maximum (peak) level (in our example, the peak is 6 dB less than the distortion level).
</p><p><b>Custom balancing</b>
</p><p>Sometimes the track may still <i>sound</i> louder in one channel than the other, even after normalizing. This usually happens because of the content. For example, one channel may have more deep bass sounds which are naturally louder, or one channel may be mostly quiet but have one loud peak. 
</p><p>To adjust each channel to its own peak volume, click the downward-pointing arrow in the <a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Track Control Panel</a> to open the <a href="audio_track_dropdown_menu.html" title="Audio Track Dropdown Menu">Audio Track Dropdown Menu</a> then choose "Split Stereo Track". Click on "Left" in the Track Control Panel of the upper track to select it, then use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="effect_menu.html#Amplify..." title="Effect Menu">Amplify...</a></span> and choose your required <a href="amplify.html" title="Amplify">New Peak Amplitude</a>. Click OK, then amplify the right channel to your chosen New Peak Amplitude. To rejoin the channels into one track, use the Track Dropdown Menu again and choose "Make Stereo Track". 
</p><p>Custom rebalancing can also be carried out during playback while the track is split into two channels, using the Gain Slider <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:TrackGain.png" class="image" title="Track Gain Slider"><img alt="Track Gain Slider" src="../m/images/a/ae/trackgain.png" width="97" height="25" /></a> on each channel. This method can lead to distortion, so check that the  <a href="meter_toolbar.html#playback" title="Meter Toolbar">Playback Meter</a> does not show the red <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i> indicator. As soon as you are happy that the balance, use <span class="menu">Tracks &gt; <a href="tracks_menu.html#Mix_and_Render" title="Tracks Menu">Mix and Render</a></span> to render the gain changes and rejoin the stereo track.  
</p><p>If the sound remains unbalanced due to a few loud peaks, you could instead use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="effect_menu.html#Compressor..." title="Effect Menu">Compressor...</a></span> on the unsplit stereo track to reduce the difference between loud and soft.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_the_recorded_waveform_not_centered_on_the_horizontal_line_at_0.0.3F">Why is the recorded waveform not centered on the horizontal line at 0.0?</span></h2>
<p><b>Cause and impact</b>
</p><p>This off-setting of a signal from zero is known as <a href="dc_offset.html" title="DC offset">DC offset</a>. A signal with DC offset would appear in the Audacity default <a href="audacity_waveform.html" title="Audacity Waveform">Waveform</a> view as not centered on the 0.0 horizontal line. 
</p><p>A sound that has DC offset will not be at its loudest possible volume when normalized or amplified (because the offset consumes <i><b><a href="glossary.html#headroom" title="Glossary">headroom</a></b></i>). This problem can possibly extend to the mix as a whole, because a sound with DC offset and a sound without DC offset will have DC offset when mixed.
</p><p>DC offset can cause clicks at the start and end of the audio or audible distortion after running effects.  
DC offset can also cause inaudible low level distortion which becomes audible after applying a <i><b><a href="glossary.html#filter" title="Glossary">filter</a></b></i> or if the audio is <a href="exporting_audio.html" title="Exporting Audio">exported</a> to a <b><i><a href="glossary.html#compressed_format" title="Glossary">compressed audio format</a>. </i></b>
</p><p><b>Removal</b>
</p><p>You can use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize...</a></span> to remove DC offset. Put a check mark in the <span class="button"><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:CheckboxChecked.png" class="image"><img alt="CheckboxChecked.png" src="../m/images/8/85/checkboxchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" /></a>&#160;Remove any DC offset...</span> box but leave the <span class="button"><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:CheckboxNotChecked.png" class="image"><img alt="CheckboxNotChecked.png" src="../m/images/a/a8/checkboxnotchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" /></a>&#160;Normalize maximum amplitude..</span> box unchecked and then press the <span class="button">OK</span> button.
</p><p><b>Hardware upgrade</b>
</p><p>The usual cause of DC offset is a faulty or inadequate soundcard.  It may be worthwhile considering upgrading your computer's built-in soundcard or purchasing an external soundcard. However recent built-in soundcards on Windows machines sometimes have a <a href="dc_offset.html#cancel" title="DC offset">DC offset cancellation</a> control which can be set for each input.
